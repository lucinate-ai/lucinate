# Agent picker

The agent picker (`selectModel` in `internal/tui/select.go`) is shown after a connection is established — either directly on startup when the connection is unambiguous, or after the user picks one from the connections picker (see [connections.md](connections.md)). It loads the list of configured agents and either presents a selection UI or auto-selects when only one agent exists. In managed mode the picker also surfaces a **Connections** action (key `c`) so the user can switch connection without first entering chat.

Agents come from the active backend (`backend.Backend.ListAgents`). For OpenClaw, that's the gateway's agent list. For OpenAI-compatible connections, agents are local — see [connections.md](connections.md#openai-agent-storage). For Hermes connections the list is one synthetic entry (the connected profile is the agent — see [backend_hermes.md](backend_hermes.md#one-profile-one-agent)) and the create-agent affordance is hidden via `Capabilities.AgentManagement`.

## Loading agents

`loadAgents()` calls `client.ListAgents()` and returns an `agentsLoadedMsg`. Each agent is an `agentItem` wrapping a `protocol.AgentSummary`. The list is displayed using a Bubble Tea list component with a custom delegate that shows the agent name (falling back to ID if no name is set).

## Auto-selection

If exactly one agent is returned, it is selected automatically without user interaction and a session is created immediately. The same auto-select fires after creating a new agent — the picker bypasses the list and proceeds straight to chat.

## Selecting an agent

Pressing Enter on a highlighted agent calls `client.CreateSession(agentID, key)`. On success, `sessionCreatedMsg` carries the new session key and the app transitions to the chat view (`newChatModel(...)`). See [sessions.md](sessions.md) for the session lifecycle from this point.

## Creating an agent

Pressing `n` in the picker switches to a creation form (`subStateCreate`). The form's shape is driven by the active backend's `Capabilities.AgentWorkspace` flag (see `backend.Capabilities`).

**OpenClaw** (workspace-aware):

- **Name** — must start with a lowercase letter and contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens. Validated on submit.
- **Workspace** — a filesystem path that is auto-suggested but editable.

On submit, `Backend.CreateAgent` is called with both fields. The gateway creates the agent and seeds an `IDENTITY.md` file in the workspace.

**OpenAI-compatible** (local-agent backends):

- **Name** — same validation rules as above.
- The workspace field is hidden. On submit, the backend seeds `IDENTITY.md` and `SOUL.md` with defaults under `~/.lucinate/agents/<connection>/<agent>/`. Users edit those files on disk to customise the agent's identity and behaviour — see [connections.md](connections.md#openai-agent-storage).

On success the agent list is reloaded and the new agent is auto-selected (see above). On failure the form stays open and the error is shown so the user can correct and retry.

## Deleting an agent

Pressing `d` on a highlighted agent enters `subStateConfirmDelete`. The substate is gated by the same `Capabilities.AgentManagement` flag as create — Hermes connections never expose it because profiles are server-managed.

The view is deliberately loud: a red header with the agent's name, a bullet list of what's about to be removed (metadata, transcript, and on OpenClaw bindings), the local backup path, a `Delete files | Keep files` toggle, and a textinput labelled with the agent's display name.

- **Type-to-confirm.** `confirm-delete` is only emitted from `Actions()` when the typed name matches the agent's display name (case-insensitive, whitespace-trimmed) and no request is in flight. That presence-toggle is the disable mechanism for native-platform embedders — the `Action` struct has no `Enabled` flag.
- **Keep files toggle.** `tab` flips `m.keepFiles`, which becomes `!DeleteFiles` on the `backend.DeleteAgentParams` sent to the backend. The view's description line switches with the toggle so the user can read what the current mode will do before pressing enter.
- **Pending state is snapshotted** (`pendingDeleteID`, `pendingDeleteName`) at substate entry from the passed `agentItem`, never re-read from `list.SelectedItem()` afterwards. A list re-render mid-flight cannot resolve the destructive cmd to the wrong agent.
- **Esc** triggers `cancel-delete` and clears all pending state. **Enter** without a matching name is a no-op.
- **Plain `d` is not bound** inside the substate because it's a printable character the user might type as part of the agent name.

`agentDeletedMsg` carries the result. On success the picker clears pending state and reloads via `loadAgents()`. On error `pendingDeleteName` is preserved so the user can retry without retyping; `deleteErr` surfaces inline. Keystrokes are ignored while `m.deleting` is true — the network call has already left.

The destructive vs preserve interpretation is per-backend:

- **OpenClaw** — `Backend.DeleteAgent` forwards to `Client.DeleteAgent(ctx, agentID, deleteFiles)`, which sends `protocol.AgentsDeleteParams{AgentID, DeleteFiles: &flag}` to the gateway. The pointer is always set explicitly — the gateway's implicit "preserve files" default never applies.
- **OpenAI-compatible** — when `DeleteFiles=true` the agent directory is wiped via `AgentStore.Delete` (`os.RemoveAll`); when false it's moved to `<root>/.archive/<id>-<unixts>/` via `AgentStore.Archive` so IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, and history.jsonl are recoverable on disk. See [backend_openai.md](backend_openai.md#agent-storage).
- **Hermes** — `DeleteAgent` returns a clear error pointing at `hermes profile delete`. The UI gate (AgentManagement=false) means the user shouldn't reach it; the reject is defensive.
